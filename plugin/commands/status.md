<objective>

Display the complete CAT hierarchy status with a visual tree showing all major versions, minor versions,
and tasks with their current status.

Provides situational awareness for project progress.

</objective>

<process>

<step name="render-status">

**Run the status script and output the result:**

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/status.sh" .claude/cat
```

This script handles BOTH data collection AND rendering with correct Unicode display widths.
It outputs a properly formatted box display directly.

If the script fails with "No planning structure found", inform user to run `/cat:init`.

**Output the script result directly to the user** - do not modify or reformat it.

</step>

<step name="next-steps">

**After the status display, show the NEXT STEPS table:**

**🚀 NEXT STEPS**

| Option | Action | Command |
|--------|--------|---------|
| [**1**] | Execute a task | `/cat:work {version}-<task-name>` |
| [**2**] | Add new task | `/cat:add` |

---

**Legend:** ☑️ Completed · 🔄 In Progress · 🔳 Pending · 🚫 Blocked · 🚧 Gate Waiting

</step>

</process>

<output_format>

The status output should be:
1. Generated by the status.sh script (NOT by LLM rendering)
2. Followed by NEXT STEPS table
3. Followed by Legend

</output_format>

<success_criteria>

- [ ] Script executed successfully
- [ ] Box display shown (from script output)
- [ ] NEXT STEPS table displayed
- [ ] Legend displayed

</success_criteria>

<history>

This skill was simplified in M142 (2026-01-19) to fix the 5th recurrence of status alignment issues
(M136→M137→M140→M141→M142).

**Root cause:** LLMs cannot reliably calculate character-level padding for Unicode text.

**Solution:** Move ALL rendering to a bash script that uses Python for width calculation.
The skill now just runs the script and outputs the result.

Previous versions had complex inline padding calculations, PRE-OUTPUT CHECKLISTs, and validation
steps - all of which failed because they still relied on LLM padding calculations.
