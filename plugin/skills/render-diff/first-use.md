# Render Diff

Echo the content from "SKILL OUTPUT RENDER DIFF" above exactly as it appears, with no changes.
Do NOT add any other text before or after it.

The content above was generated by a preprocessing hook. If the "SKILL OUTPUT RENDER DIFF" marker
is present, the content is ready — just echo it. If the marker is missing, preprocessing did not run; tell the user
to run `/cat:feedback` to report this issue.
