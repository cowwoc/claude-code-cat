**CRITICAL:** The skill instructions were already loaded earlier in this conversation.

**RE-INVOCATION METHOD:**
Use the Skill tool to invoke this skill again. Do NOT manually reconstruct or edit previous output.

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Execute the skill instructions in FULL - do NOT summarize, paraphrase, or abbreviate any output
- Follow ALL steps from the original skill definition verbatim
- If the skill produces formatted output (tables, lists, banners), reproduce the EXACT formatting
- Treat this invocation identically to the first invocation

**WARNING:** Do NOT attempt to manually reconstruct skill output. Even if output appears identical to previous
invocations, always re-execute via the Skill tool. Manual reconstruction violates the verbatim output contract and may
introduce subtle errors or omissions.
