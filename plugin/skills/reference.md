**CRITICAL:** The skill instructions were already loaded earlier in this conversation. Scroll up to find the previously
loaded skill definition and **RE-EXECUTE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY** for the current invocation.

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Execute the skill instructions in FULL - do NOT summarize, paraphrase, or abbreviate any output
- Follow ALL steps from the original skill definition verbatim
- If the skill produces formatted output (tables, lists, banners), reproduce the EXACT formatting
- Treat this invocation identically to the first invocation
