# Status

SKILL OUTPUT STATUS DISPLAY:
!`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/bin/get-status-output"`

Echo the content from "SKILL OUTPUT STATUS DISPLAY" above exactly as it appears, with no changes.
Do NOT add any other text before or after it, except the NEXT STEPS table below.

The content above was generated by a preprocessing hook. If the "SKILL OUTPUT STATUS DISPLAY" marker
is present, the content is ready — just echo it. If the marker is missing, preprocessing did not run; tell the user
to run `/cat:feedback` to report this issue.

Then after the status display, output:

**NEXT STEPS**

| Option | Action | Command |
|--------|--------|---------|
| [**1**] | Execute an issue | `/cat:work {version}-<issue-name>` |
| [**2**] | Add new issue | `/cat:add` |
