Interactive configuration wizard to customize CAT settings. Displays current configuration and guides
users through modifying their preferences.

## Pre-rendered Config Boxes

<step name="read-config">

<step name="read-config">

**Read current configuration:**

```bash
cat .claude/cat/cat-config.json
```

If file doesn't exist, inform user to run `/cat:init` first.

</step>

<step name="display-settings">

**MANDATORY (M130/A021) - Display-Before-Prompt Protocol:**

BLOCKING REQUIREMENT: You MUST output a visual display box BEFORE calling AskUserQuestion.

**Output the SCRIPT OUTPUT CONFIG DISPLAY from context**

Copy the exact box from the "SCRIPT OUTPUT CONFIG DISPLAY" context. Do NOT recompute or modify alignment.

**Why pre-rendering:** Agents miscalculate emoji widths, causing misaligned box borders.
The handler config_handler.py calculates correct widths before the skill starts.

</step>

<step name="main-menu">

**CHECKPOINT (M132): Verify settings box was displayed in previous step. If not, STOP and output it now.**

**Present main menu using AskUserQuestion:**

Show current values in descriptions using data from read-config step.

<step name="cat-behavior">

**🐱 CAT Behavior selection:**

**MANDATORY (M137) - Display behavior summary BEFORE prompting:**

    description: "Defer to current version"
  - label: "Low"

**Priority-based deferral (when patience is high):**

</step>

<step name="cleanup">

**🧹 Cleanup selection:**

**If Custom value selected:**

AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Custom Width"
- question: "Enter terminal width (40-200):"
- options: ["← Back"]

Validate input is a number between 40-200. If invalid, show error and re-prompt.

**Update config with safe jq pattern:**
```bash
jq '.terminalWidth = {value}' .claude/cat/cat-config.json > .claude/cat/cat-config.json.tmp \

  && mv .claude/cat/cat-config.json.tmp .claude/cat/cat-config.json
```

</step>

<step name="version-gates">

**📊 Version Gates configuration:**

Use the **VERSION_GATES_OVERVIEW** box from Pre-rendered Config Boxes.

**Step 1: Select version to configure**

First, scan for available versions:
```bash
ls -1d .claude/cat/v[0-9]*/v[0-9]*.[0-9]* 2>/dev/null | \
  sed 's|.claude/cat/v[0-9]*/v||' | sort -V
```

Determine current minor version from ROADMAP.md (first non-completed).

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Select Version"
- question: "Which version's gates do you want to configure?"
- options:
  - "v{X}.{Y-1} - Previous minor" (if exists)
  - "v{X}.{Y} - Current minor" (highlighted)
  - "v{X}.{Y+1} - Next minor" (if exists)
  - "Enter version number" - Custom input

**If "Enter version number":**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Version"
- question: "Enter the version number (e.g., 0.5 or just 0 for major):"
- options: ["← Back"]

Parse input to determine if major (single digit) or minor (X.Y format).

**Step 2: Display current gates**

Read the PLAN.md for selected version:
```bash
cat .claude/cat/issues/v{major}/v{major}.{minor}/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || \
cat .claude/cat/issues/v{major}/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

Extract the `## Gates` section and use the **GATES_FOR_VERSION** box from Pre-rendered Config Boxes.
Replace `{version}` and gate descriptions with actual values.

**Step 3: Choose action**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Action"
- question: "What would you like to do?"
- options:
  - label: "Edit entry gate"
    description: "Change when work can start"
  - label: "Edit exit gate"
    description: "Change completion criteria"
  - label: "View another version"
    description: "Select a different version"
  - label: "← Back"
    description: "Return to main menu"

**Step 4a: Edit entry gate**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Entry Gate"
- question: "Select entry conditions (current: {current conditions}):"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "Previous version complete" - sequential dependency
  - "Specific issue(s) complete" - named issues required
  - "Specific version(s) complete" - named versions required
  - "Manual approval required" - explicit sign-off

If "Specific issue(s) complete":
- Ask: "Which issue(s)? (e.g., 0.5-design-review, comma-separated)"

If "Specific version(s) complete":
- Ask: "Which version(s)? (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, comma-separated)"

**Step 4b: Edit exit gate**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Exit Gate"
- question: "Select exit conditions (current: {current conditions}):"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "All issues complete" - every issue in version done
  - "Specific issue(s) complete" - only named issues required
  - "Tests passing" - test suite must pass
  - "Manual sign-off" - explicit approval

If "Specific issue(s) complete":
- Ask: "Which issue(s)? (comma-separated)"

**Step 5: Update PLAN.md**

Read the version's PLAN.md, update the `## Gates` section:

```markdown
## Gates

### Entry
- {condition 1}
- {condition 2}

### Exit
- {condition 1}
- {condition 2}
```

If the PLAN.md doesn't have a `## Gates` section, insert it after `## Focus` or `## Vision`.

Write the updated PLAN.md using the Write tool.

**Step 6: Confirm and loop**

Use the **GATES_UPDATED** box from Pre-rendered Config Boxes.
Replace `{version}`, `{new-entry-gate}`, `{new-exit-gate}` with actual values.

Return to Step 3 (Choose action) to allow further edits or navigation.

</step>

<step name="update-config">

**Update configuration file:**

```bash
# Safe jq update pattern
jq '.settingName = "newValue"' .claude/cat/cat-config.json > .claude/cat/cat-config.json.tmp \
  && mv .claude/cat/cat-config.json.tmp .claude/cat/cat-config.json
```

</step>

<step name="confirm">

**Confirm change and return to parent menu:**

Use the **SETTING_UPDATED** box from Pre-rendered Config Boxes.
Replace `{setting-name}`, `{old-value}`, `{new-value}` with actual values.

**After confirming**: Return to the **parent menu** and re-display its options.

Examples:
- Changed "Trust" → return to CAT Behavior menu
- Changed "Context window size" → return to Context Limits menu
- Changed "Cleanup" → return to Cleanup/Gates menu

</step>

<step name="exit">

**Exit screen:**

If changes were made:

Use the **CONFIGURATION_SAVED** box from Pre-rendered Config Boxes.

If no changes:

Use the **NO_CHANGES** box from Pre-rendered Config Boxes.

</step>

</process>
