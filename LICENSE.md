# CAT Commercial License

Version 1.0

## Hi! Here's what you need to know:

| Tier | Who it's for |
|------|--------------|
| **Indie** | Solo developers — full CAT, single user, always free |
| **Team** | Teams of 1-50 — adds collaboration features |
| **Enterprise** | Organizations 50+ — adds compliance & integrations |

For current pricing, see [PRICING.md](docs/PRICING.md).

**Indie is free** - Working alone? Building a side project? Learning?
You get full CAT functionality at no cost. No time limits, no feature crippling.

**Team unlocks collaboration** - When you need task locking (so two devs don't
work the same task), shared config, team analytics, or cross-session handoff,
upgrade to Team. Solo developers may purchase Team for a single seat if they
want collaboration features for future team growth or personal use.

**Enterprise adds compliance** - SSO/SAML, audit logs, issue tracker sync,
Slack integration, custom LLM endpoints, SLA support.

**Billing basics:**
- Team: monthly or annual (annual = 2 months free)
- Enterprise: annual only
- Cancel anytime, 30 days before renewal
- If payment fails, you have 14 days to fix it before downgrade to Indie
- Working offline? 30-day grace period so CI/CD and air-gapped setups work fine

**Building a product with CAT?**
- If your product runs CAT for your users (like a code formatting SaaS),
  each user needs their own license.
- If you're just using CAT internally to keep your own codebase tidy,
  your customers don't need licenses - only your team does.

**About forks** - If someone forks CAT, commercial users still need to
get their license from me (the original author). This keeps things fair and
prevents someone from just repackaging the project.

**Don't be shady** - No tampering with license keys, no sharing keys between
companies, no bypassing the license check, no lying about seat counts.

**The fine print** - No warranty, and if you break the rules you lose your
license. The legal details are below.

## Legal Terms

The following sections contain the legally binding license terms.

## Acceptance

To use, copy, modify, or distribute this software, you must accept these
license terms.

## Definitions

**"Software"** means the CAT software and all associated source
code, documentation, and related files in this repository.

**"Licensor"** means the original author and copyright holder of the Software.

**"You"** means the individual or entity exercising rights under this license.

**"Personal Use"** means use by an individual for personal, educational,
research, experimental, or hobby purposes, where the use is not intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

**"Commercial Use"** means any use of the Software that is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This
includes, but is not limited to:
- Use by a for-profit company or organization
- Use by employees in the course of their employment (covered under employer's license)
- Use by contractors performing work for a licensed organization (covered under that organization's license while performing such work)
- Use in developing, testing, or deploying commercial products or services
- Use in providing paid consulting or professional services (requires consultant's own license unless client provides access under their license)

**"Indie Use"** means use by a single individual user, regardless of whether
that use is personal or commercial. Indie Use is free and does not require
a paid license, but is limited to a single user seat.

**"Team Features"** means collaboration functionality including but not limited
to: task locking, shared configuration sync, team activity feeds, cross-session
handoff, branch naming policies, team analytics, and project token budgets.

**"Enterprise Features"** means compliance and integration functionality
including but not limited to: SSO/SAML authentication, audit log export,
issue tracker synchronization, messaging platform notifications, custom LLM
endpoints, webhook APIs, data residency options, and SLA support.

**"Derivative Work"** means any work that is based on or derived from the
Software, including modifications, translations, adaptations, and works
that incorporate substantial portions of the Software.

## Grant of Rights for Indie Use

Subject to the terms of this license, the Licensor grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

1. Use the Software for Indie Use (single user, personal or commercial)
2. Copy and distribute the Software
3. Modify the Software and create Derivative Works
4. Distribute Derivative Works

**Indie Use is free** — A single individual may use CAT for any purpose,
including commercial work, without purchasing a license. This grant covers
all core CAT functionality but excludes Team Features and Enterprise Features.

## Team and Enterprise Features Require a Paid License

**Access to Team Features requires a Team license.**

**Access to Enterprise Features requires an Enterprise license.**

**Payment and Renewal Terms:**

- **Team licenses** are billed monthly or annually at Your choice. Annual billing
  provides two months free (pay for 10 months, receive 12 months of access).
- **Enterprise licenses** are billed annually. Volume discounts may be available
  for large deployments; contact the Licensor for details.
- Licenses renew automatically unless cancelled at least thirty (30) days before
  the renewal date. You may cancel at any time through Your account dashboard.
- Upon cancellation or non-renewal, paid features will be disabled at the end of
  the current billing period. Your data and configurations will be retained for
  ninety (90) days to allow for reactivation or export.

**Payment Failure**: If a payment fails, the Licensor will attempt to process
the payment up to three (3) times over a fourteen (14) day period. You will
receive email notification of each failed attempt. If payment cannot be
collected after the retry period, Your license will be downgraded to Indie
tier and paid features will be disabled. To restore access, update Your
payment method and contact support.

If You wish to use Team Features or Enterprise Features, You must purchase
the appropriate license directly from the Licensor. See https://cat.dev/pricing
for current pricing and terms.

**Seat Limits**: Each Team or Enterprise license includes a defined number of
seats. A "seat" represents one unique user (identified by machine or account).
When all licensed seats are in use, additional users will be unable to access
paid features until either: (a) an existing seat is released (via deactivation),
or (b) additional seats are purchased. Core Indie functionality remains
available to all users regardless of seat limits.

**Grace Periods**: If the Software cannot validate Your license due to network
unavailability, You will have a thirty (30) day grace period during which paid
features remain accessible. After the grace period expires, paid features will
be disabled until validation succeeds. This grace period is designed to prevent
disruption to CI/CD pipelines and offline development environments.

## Runtime Redistribution Requires Per-User Licensing

**"Runtime Redistribution"** means incorporating the Software into a product
or service that invokes the Software on behalf of end users at runtime.

If Your product or service performs Runtime Redistribution, **each end user
who benefits from the Software's functionality must have their own valid
commercial license from the Licensor.**

Examples:
- A SaaS code formatting service that uses CAT → each user needs a license
- A hosted IDE that invokes CAT for users → each user needs a license
- A CI/CD platform that runs CAT for customers → each customer needs a license

**Internal tooling exception**: If Your organization uses CAT solely for
internal development purposes (e.g., formatting Your own codebase during
build), and Your product does not invoke CAT at runtime for end users,
then Your end users do not require their own licenses.

## Derivative Works and Commercial Use

**Commercial Use of any Derivative Work also requires a paid license from
the original Licensor (not the creator of the Derivative Work).**

If You create a Derivative Work and another party wishes to use that
Derivative Work for Commercial Use, that party must obtain a commercial
license from the original Licensor. Fork maintainers and Derivative Work
creators cannot grant commercial use rights.

This ensures that:
- The original author is compensated for all Commercial Use
- Fork maintainers cannot commercially exploit the original work
- Commercial users always know to contact the original Licensor

## Conditions

You must:

1. **Preserve Notices**: Keep all copyright, license, and attribution notices
   intact in all copies and Derivative Works.

2. **Include License**: Distribute copies of this license with any
   distribution of the Software or Derivative Works.

3. **State Changes**: If You distribute a Derivative Work, clearly indicate
   that changes were made and provide attribution to the original Software.

4. **No Trademark Rights**: This license does not grant any rights to use the
   Licensor's trademarks, trade names, or service marks.

## No Circumvention

You may not:

1. Remove, alter, or obscure any licensing or copyright notices
2. Use technical measures to restrict others from exercising rights under
   this license that they would otherwise have
3. Sublicense the Software or grant commercial use rights to third parties
4. Forge, tamper with, or create counterfeit license keys
5. Share license keys across organizations or redistribute keys publicly
6. Bypass, disable, or interfere with the license validation system
7. Misrepresent the number of seats or users accessing the Software

## Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE LICENSOR MAKES
NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Termination

Your rights under this license terminate automatically if You fail to comply
with any of its terms. Upon termination, You must cease all use and
distribution of the Software and destroy all copies in Your possession.

## No Automatic Conversion

This license does not contain any provision for automatic conversion to an
open-source license. The terms of this license remain in effect indefinitely
unless explicitly changed by the Licensor through a new license version.

of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides, without regard to its
conflict of law provisions.
