## The Problem with AI Projects

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/problem.png" alt="The problem with AI projects" width="600"/>
</p>

This is what herding cats feels like. Brilliant, forgetful, easily distracted cats.
**CAT flips this around.**

You tell CAT your style once. It learns what matters to you. Then it handles the routine stuff automatically while presenting you with meaningful choices at genuine decision points. It's an adventure where you're the author — the plot moves when you say so, and nobody rewrites act two while you're getting coffee.

</p>

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Join the Adventure

```bash
# Add the plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add cowwoc/claude-code-cat

# Install CAT
/plugin install cat@cowwoc-claude-code-cat

# Verify you're ready
/cat:help
```

### Step 2: Initialize Your Quest

```bash
/cat:init
```

CAT will ask about your project and your preferences:

<p align="center">
  <a href="#quick-start"><img src="docs/choose-adventurer.svg" alt="Choose Your Adventurer" width="500"/></a>
</p>

Your answers shape how CAT makes decisions throughout your project.

### Step 3: Chart Your Course

```bash
# Define your first major version (the big picture)
/cat:add-major-version

# Add tasks (optionally specify target version)
/cat:add-task [version]

# See your adventure map
/cat:status
```

### Step 4: Begin the Quest

```bash
/cat:execute-task
```

CAT spawns a subagent in an isolated worktree, executes the task, and presents
you with results at a checkpoint:

## How CAT Works

### The Map: Hierarchical Planning

Every adventure needs a map. CAT organizes work into three levels:

<p align="center">
  <a href="#the-map-hierarchical-planning">
    <img src="docs/hierarchy.svg" alt="Hierarchy" width="500"/>
  </a>
</p>

- **Major versions** are your milestones (v1: "Core Features", v2: "Polish & Performance")
- **Minor versions** group related work (v1.0: "Authentication", v1.1: "User Profiles")
- **Tasks** are individual quests sized to fit in a single session

### The Compass: Your Preferences

During `/cat:init`, you choose your adventurer style:

| Preference | What it Controls |
|------------|------------------|
| **Trust** | How much you trust CAT to make decisions autonomously |
| **Verify** | What verification CAT runs before checkpoints |
| **Curiosity** | Whether CAT notices optimization opportunities beyond the task |
| **Patience** | When CAT acts on discovered opportunities |

These aren't just settings—they're how CAT learns to think like you.

### The Journey: Task Lifecycle

<p align="center">
  <a href="#the-journey-task-lifecycle">
    <img src="docs/task-lifecycle.svg" alt="Task Lifecycle" width="500"/>
  </a>
</p>

Each task follows this path:

1. **Planning** → PLAN.md defines the quest objectives
2. **Approach Selection** → At forks in the road, you choose the path
3. **Execution** → Subagent works in isolation (no risk to your main branch)
4. **Verification** → Build, test, lint—all must pass
5. **Review** → Optional stakeholder council weighs in
6. **Checkpoint** → You approve or request changes
7. **Completion** → Merged to main, progress saved

### The Safety Net: Reliability Features

Adventures are more fun when you're not worried about falling:

- **Token-Aware Tasks** → Tasks sized to fit within context limits
- **Isolated Worktrees** → Each task runs in its own git worktree
- **Automatic State Tracking** → Never lose progress between sessions
- **Learn from Mistakes** → CAT analyzes failures and prevents repeats
- **Quality Gates** → Multi-perspective reviews catch issues early

| `/cat:remove-task` | Remove a quest from the map |

---

## Configuration

Your adventure settings live in `.claude/cat/cat-config.json`:

```json
{
  "yoloMode": false,
  "contextLimit": 200000,
  "targetContextUsage": 40,
  "trust": "medium",
  "verify": "changed",
  "curiosity": "low",
  "patience": "high"
}
```

### Options Reference

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `yoloMode` | boolean | `false` | Skip all approval gates when `true` |
| `contextLimit` | number | `200000` | Total context window size in tokens |
| `targetContextUsage` | number | `40` | Soft limit percentage for task size |
| `trust` | string | `medium` | How much you trust CAT to decide autonomously |
| `verify` | string | `changed` | What verification runs before checkpoints |
| `curiosity` | string | `low` | Whether CAT notices opportunities beyond the task |
| `patience` | string | `high` | When CAT acts on discovered opportunities |

**yoloMode**
- `false` (Interactive) — Checkpoints after each task, you review and approve changes
- `true` (YOLO) — Automatic progression, skips approval checkpoints

**contextLimit** — The maximum tokens available in your model's context window. Used to calculate
when tasks need decomposition.

**targetContextUsage** — Percentage of `contextLimit` that triggers context warnings. At 40% of
200K (80K tokens), CAT warns that the task may need decomposition.

**trust** — How much trust you place in CAT to make decisions:
- `low` — CAT presents options frequently; you guide most decisions
- `medium` — CAT presents options for meaningful trade-offs; handles routine choices
- `high` — CAT decides autonomously; only presents HIGH risk or architectural choices

**verify** — What verification CAT runs before presenting changes:
- `none` — No verification; fastest iteration
- `changed` — Verify modified file/module only; balanced confidence
- `all` — Verify entire project; highest confidence before checkpoint

**curiosity** — Whether CAT notices optimization opportunities while working:
- `low` — Stays focused; only completes the assigned task
- `medium` — Notes obvious issues in touched files; documents but doesn't act
- `high` — Actively explores for improvements; documents opportunities found

**patience** — When CAT acts on opportunities discovered during work:
- `low` — Acts immediately on high-priority discoveries (benefit/cost > 3)
- `medium` — Defers most discoveries; acts on critical issues only
- `high` — Defers all discoveries to backlog; maximum focus on current task

**Note:** Stakeholder review (architect, security, quality, tester, performance) runs automatically
based on task characteristics—not a global setting. High-risk indicators like security changes,
5+ files touched, or public API modifications trigger the review council.

## Skills Reference

Skills are specialized abilities CAT can invoke. Most run automatically, but some
you can call directly:

### Git Operations
`git-commit` · `git-squash` · `git-rebase` · `git-amend` · `git-merge-linear`

### Multi-Agent Coordination
`spawn-subagent` · `monitor-subagents` · `collect-results` · `merge-subagent` · `parallel-execute`

### Quality & Learning
`stakeholder-review` · `learn-from-mistakes` · `run-retrospective` · `decompose-task`

## Project Structure

After `/cat:init`, your project gains an adventure journal:

```
your-project/
└── .claude/cat/
    ├── PROJECT.md          # Your quest overview
    ├── ROADMAP.md          # The big picture
    ├── cat-config.json     # Your preferences
    └── v1/                 # Major version 1
        ├── STATE.md        # Chapter progress
        ├── PLAN.md         # Chapter objectives
        └── v1.0/           # Minor version
            ├── STATE.md    # Section progress
            └── setup-auth/ # Individual task
                ├── STATE.md
                └── PLAN.md
```

## Tips for a Successful Adventure

**Start small** — Begin with one major version and a few tasks. Expand as you
find your rhythm.

**Check your map** — Run `/cat:status` often. It shows where you are and
suggests next steps.

**Scout unfamiliar territory** — Use `/cat:research` before tackling complex
features in unknown domains.

**Clear the fog** — Run `/clear` between tasks to start fresh with full context.

**Trust the process** — CAT tracks state automatically. If a session ends
mid-task, just run `/cat:execute-task` to continue where you left off.

## Contributing

CAT is opinionated by design. It does a few things well rather than everything
poorly.

Contributions are welcome when they:
- Solve real problems encountered during structured project execution
- Align with the existing adventure-style workflow
- Maintain the focused nature of the tool

Open an issue to discuss before investing significant effort.
