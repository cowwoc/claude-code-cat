# <img src="docs/cat-logo.svg" height="36" alt="CAT logo"> CAT: AI Agents that land on their feet

A Claude Code plugin for structured project execution with multi-agent orchestration.

```
MAJOR VERSION -> MINOR VERSION -> TASK
     v1/            v1.0/          setup-auth/
```

## Why CAT?

Large projects fail in AI assistants because context windows overflow. CAT solves this by:

- **Hierarchical planning** - Break work into Major > Minor > Task levels
- **Token-aware execution** - Tasks sized to fit within context limits
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Subagents execute in isolated worktrees
- **Quality gates** - Approval checkpoints prevent runaway changes
- **Automatic state tracking** - Never lose progress between sessions
- **Continuous improvement** - Learns from mistakes and runs regular retrospectives

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add cowwoc/cat

# Install the plugin
/plugin install cat@cowwoc-claude-code-cat

# Verify installation
/cat:help
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
# New project
/cat:init

# Answer the guided questions about your project
```

### 3. Start Working

```bash
# Add your first major version
/cat:add-major-version

# Add tasks to it
/cat:add-task 1.0

# Execute tasks
/cat:execute-task
```

## Commands Reference

### Core Workflow

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cat:init` | Initialize CAT structure (new or existing project). Guided wizard creates PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, and config. |
| `/cat:execute-task [id]` | Execute a task. Creates worktree, runs work, handles approval gate, merges to main. ID format: `1.0-task-name` |
| `/cat:status` | Show visual tree of all versions and tasks with progress bars and status indicators. |
| `/cat:help` | Display complete command and skill reference. |

### Adding Structure

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cat:add-major-version` | Add a new major version. Collaborative discussion helps crystallize your vision. |
| `/cat:add-minor-version [major]` | Add minor version to a major (e.g., `1` adds v1.1). For bugfixes and smaller features. |
| `/cat:add-task [major.minor]` | Add task to minor version (e.g., `1.0` adds to v1.0). Generates comprehensive PLAN.md. |

### Removing Structure

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cat:remove-major-version` | Remove a major version and all its contents. |
| `/cat:remove-minor-version` | Remove a minor version and all its tasks. |
| `/cat:remove-task` | Remove a specific task. |

### Utilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cat:cleanup` | Clean up abandoned worktrees, lock files, and orphaned branches from crashed sessions. |
| `/cat:research [topic]` | Research implementation approaches before planning. Use for moderate/high complexity features where the best approach isn't obvious. |

## Session Instructions

CAT automatically injects the following instructions into Claude's context on every session start
(including after context compaction). These ensure consistent behavior without modifying your
project's CLAUDE.md file.

### User Input Handling
- Process ALL user input IMMEDIATELY, regardless of how it arrives
- User input sources: direct messages, system-reminders with "The user sent the following message:",
  or system-reminders with "MUST"/"Before proceeding"/"AGENT INSTRUCTION"
- Priority order: mandatory system-reminders → hook actions → user message content
- When input arrives mid-operation: stop, add to TodoWrite, acknowledge before continuing
- Never ignore issues or assume you'll remember—always TodoWrite immediately

### Mistake Handling
- Invoke `learn-from-mistakes` skill for ANY mistake (protocol violations, rework, failures)
- Analyzes root cause, implements prevention, records learning for retrospectives

### Skill Workflow Compliance
- When a skill is invoked, follow its documented workflow COMPLETELY
- Never invoke a skill then manually do a subset of steps
- Execute every step in sequence; if a step doesn't apply, note why and continue

### Commit Before Review
- ALWAYS commit changes BEFORE asking users to review implementation
- Users cannot see unstaged changes in their environment
- Pattern: Implement → Commit → Then ask for review

## Project Structure

After running `/cat:init`:

```
your-project/
└── .claude/cat/
    ├── PROJECT.md              # Project overview, goals, requirements
    ├── ROADMAP.md              # High-level version summaries
    ├── cat-config.json         # Plugin configuration
    └── v1/                     # Major version 1
        ├── STATE.md            # Major version state & progress
        ├── PLAN.md             # Business-level objectives
        ├── CHANGELOG.md        # What was accomplished (aggregates tasks)
        └── v1.0/               # Version 1.0 (major 1, minor 0)
            ├── STATE.md        # Minor version state
            ├── PLAN.md         # Feature-level plan
            ├── CHANGELOG.md    # Minor changelog (aggregates tasks)
            └── setup-auth/     # Individual task
                ├── STATE.md    # Task state (pending/in-progress/completed)
                └── PLAN.md     # Detailed execution steps
```

> **NOTE**: Task changelog content is embedded in commit messages, not separate files.

## Configuration

Edit `.claude/cat/cat-config.json`:

```json
{
  "yoloMode": false,
  "contextLimit": 200000,
  "targetContextUsage": 40,
  "autoCleanupWorktrees": true
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `yoloMode` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, skips approval gates and auto-proceeds. When `false`, requires user approval at each task completion. |
| `contextLimit` | number | `200000` | Total context window size in tokens. Set based on your Claude model's limit. |
| `targetContextUsage` | number | `40` | Target maximum context usage as a percentage (40 = 40%). Tasks are sized to stay within this limit. At 200K context, 40 means ~80K tokens per task. |
| `autoCleanupWorktrees` | boolean | `true` | When `true`, automatically removes worktrees and task branches after successful merge. When `false`, keeps them for manual inspection. |

### Operating Modes

**Interactive Mode** (default, `yoloMode: false`)
- Approval gates at task completion
- Review changes before merge
- Request modifications if needed
- Full control over what gets merged

**YOLO Mode** (`yoloMode: true`)
- Approval gates skipped
- Automatic merge on task completion
- Faster execution for trusted workflows
- Best for well-defined, low-risk tasks

## Available Skills

Skills are internal capabilities used by commands. Some can be invoked directly.

**Important:** When invoking skills via the Skill tool, use the full name with `cat:` prefix:

## Task Lifecycle

```
PENDING → IN-PROGRESS → COMPLETED
   │           │            │
   │           │            └── Merged to main, worktree cleaned
   │           └── Executing in isolated worktree
   └── Dependencies not yet met
```

1. **Task Created** - PLAN.md defines what to do
2. **Dependencies Check** - Waits for task and minor version dependencies
3. **Size Analysis** - Auto-decompose if estimated tokens exceed threshold
4. **Worktree Created** - Isolated git worktree for safe execution
5. **Execution** - Subagent execution with token tracking and metrics reporting
6. **Build Verification** - Compile, test, lint checks must pass
7. **Stakeholder Review** - Multi-perspective review (architect, security, quality, tester, performance)
8. **Approval Gate** - User reviews changes (interactive mode)
9. **Merge & Cleanup** - STATE.md updated, commits squashed by type, merged to main, worktree removed

## Status Indicators

When viewing `/cat:status`:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[>]` | In progress |
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[!]` | Blocked (dependencies not met) |

## Tips

- **Start small** - Begin with one major version and a few tasks
- **Clear `/clear`** - Run `/clear` between tasks for fresh context
- **Check status** - Use `/cat:status` to see where you are
- **Research first** - Use `/cat:research` for unfamiliar domains before planning
- **YOLO wisely** - Only enable YOLO mode for well-understood, low-risk work

## Uninstall

```bash
/plugin uninstall cat
```

## Contributing

CAT is primarily a driver for my own projects. It's not intended to be a kitchen sink of every
possible feature—the focus is on doing a few things well rather than accumulating tangentially
related functionality.

Contributions are welcome when they:
- Align with the plugin's existing functionality and style
- Solve real problems encountered during structured project execution
- Maintain the focused, opinionated nature of the tool

If you're unsure whether a contribution fits, open an issue to discuss before investing significant
effort.
