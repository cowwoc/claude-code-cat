   Low trust. CAT presents options frequently:
   where to place code, which approach to take, how to name things.

   ✦ Best for: Learning, strong preferences, critical projects

🐱─ ─ ┈  MEDIUM {trust == 'medium' ? '(current)' : ''}
   Moderate trust. CAT handles routine decisions
   but presents options for meaningful trade-offs.

   ✦ Best for: Balanced control and efficiency

🐱─ ─ ─ ─ ┈  HIGH {trust == 'high' ? '(current)' : ''}
   High trust. CAT decides most things autonomously.
   Only presents options when genuinely ambiguous.

   No verification before commit. Fastest iteration
   but won't catch any errors automatically.

   ✦ Best for: Rapid prototyping, manual verification

📦 CHANGED {verify == 'changed' ? '(current)' : ''}
   Verify modified file/module only. Catches most
   regressions without verifying the full project.

   ✦ Best for: Most workflows

🔒 ALL {verify == 'all' ? '(current)' : ''}
   Verify the entire project before each commit.
   Slowest but highest confidence.

   Defer to current version. Log improvements as
   separate tasks within the current version.

   ✦ Best for: Focused tasks with nearby follow-up

📅 HIGH {patience == 'high' ? '(current)' : ''}
   Defer by priority. Schedule improvements to future
   versions based on benefit/cost ratio.

   ✦ Best for: Surgical tasks, controlled scope

<step name="version-gates">

**📊 Version Gates configuration:**

Display current gate overview:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 VERSION GATES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Gates control when work can start and when it's done.
Each version can have entry (start) and exit (done) gates.

Major gates are inherited by all minor versions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Step 1: Select version to configure**

First, scan for available versions:
```bash
ls -1d .claude/cat/v[0-9]*/v[0-9]*.[0-9]* 2>/dev/null | \
  sed 's|.claude/cat/v[0-9]*/v||' | sort -V
```

Determine current minor version from ROADMAP.md (first non-completed).

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Select Version"
- question: "Which version's gates do you want to configure?"
- options:
  - "v{X}.{Y-1} - Previous minor" (if exists)
  - "v{X}.{Y} - Current minor" (highlighted)
  - "v{X}.{Y+1} - Next minor" (if exists)
  - "Enter version number" - Custom input

**If "Enter version number":**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Version"
- question: "Enter the version number (e.g., 0.5 or just 0 for major):"
- options: ["← Back"]

Parse input to determine if major (single digit) or minor (X.Y format).

**Step 2: Display current gates**

Read the PLAN.md for selected version:
```bash
cat .claude/cat/v{major}/v{major}.{minor}/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || \
cat .claude/cat/v{major}/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

Extract and display the `## Gates` section:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 Gates for v{version}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ENTRY (when can work start?):
• {condition 1}
• {condition 2}

EXIT (when is it done?):
• {condition 1}
• {condition 2}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If no gates section exists, display:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ No gates configured for v{version}

Default behavior applies:
• Entry: Previous version must complete
• Exit: All tasks must complete

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Step 3: Choose action**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Action"
- question: "What would you like to do?"
- options:
  - label: "Edit entry gate"
    description: "Change when work can start"
  - label: "Edit exit gate"
    description: "Change completion criteria"
  - label: "View another version"
    description: "Select a different version"
  - label: "← Back"
    description: "Return to main menu"

**Step 4a: Edit entry gate**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Entry Gate"
- question: "Select entry conditions (current: {current conditions}):"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "Previous version complete" - sequential dependency
  - "Specific task(s) complete" - named tasks required
  - "Specific version(s) complete" - named versions required
  - "Manual approval required" - explicit sign-off

If "Specific task(s) complete":
- Ask: "Which task(s)? (e.g., 0.5-design-review, comma-separated)"

If "Specific version(s) complete":
- Ask: "Which version(s)? (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, comma-separated)"

**Step 4b: Edit exit gate**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Exit Gate"
- question: "Select exit conditions (current: {current conditions}):"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "All tasks complete" - every task in version done
  - "Specific task(s) complete" - only named tasks required
  - "Tests passing" - test suite must pass
  - "Manual sign-off" - explicit approval

If "Specific task(s) complete":
- Ask: "Which task(s)? (comma-separated)"

**Step 5: Update PLAN.md**

Read the version's PLAN.md, update the `## Gates` section:

```markdown
## Gates

### Entry
- {condition 1}
- {condition 2}

### Exit
- {condition 1}
- {condition 2}
```

If the PLAN.md doesn't have a `## Gates` section, insert it after `## Focus` or `## Vision`.

Write the updated PLAN.md using the Write tool.

**Step 6: Confirm and loop**

Display confirmation:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Gates updated for v{version}

Entry: {summary of entry conditions}
Exit:  {summary of exit conditions}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Return to Step 3 (Choose action) to allow further edits or navigation.

</step>

<step name="update-config">

**Update configuration file:**

```bash
# Safe jq update pattern
jq '.settingName = "newValue"' .claude/cat/cat-config.json > .claude/cat/cat-config.json.tmp \
  && mv .claude/cat/cat-config.json.tmp .claude/cat/cat-config.json
```

</step>

<step name="confirm">

**Confirm change and return to parent menu:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Setting updated

   {setting}: {oldValue} → {newValue}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**After confirming**: Return to the **parent menu** and re-display its options.

Examples:
- Changed "Trust" → return to CAT Behavior menu
- Changed "Context window size" → return to Context Limits menu
- Changed "Game Mode" → return to main menu (no parent submenu)
- Changed "Cleanup" → return to Cleanup/Gates menu

</step>
