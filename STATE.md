- **Resolution:** implemented - Added -first-use skill pattern: SkillLoader now checks for {name}-first-use/SKILL.md companion files with <skill>/<output> XML tags, strips YAML frontmatter, and appends dynamic output on every invocation. Created status-first-use, run-retrospective-first-use, and statusline-first-use companion skills. Deleted old first-use.md files. Updated skill-loading.md documentation.
