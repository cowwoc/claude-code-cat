## The Problem with AI Projects

<p align="center">
  <img src="problem.png" alt="The problem with AI projects" width="600"/>
</p>

This is what herding cats feels like. Brilliant, forgetful, easily distracted cats.

You ask for a button. You get a refactored auth module, migrated frameworks, and a utils.js you
didn't ask for.

Or worse: AI generates code faster than you can review it. Bugs compound. Technical debt
accumulates. Your codebase looks productive but crumbles under pressure.

Two failure modes. Same root cause: **AI that races ahead instead of moving forward with you.**

## CAT Flips This Around

You tell CAT your style once. It learns what matters to you.

Then it does what you ask—nothing more, nothing less—while presenting you with meaningful choices
at genuine decision points.

- Ask for a button, get a button
- Every change committed before moving on
- Every git operation backed up automatically
- Every mistake learned from, not repeated
- You're in control—work progresses when you say so

**The goal isn't to write more code. It's to write code you can trust.**

## Why CAT?

### Two Problems. One Solution.

**Problem 1: The Overeager Assistant**
```
"Add a login button"
→ AI redesigns auth, migrates frameworks, reorganizes
→ You wanted a button, you got a rewrite
→ Now you're debugging code you didn't ask for
```

**Problem 2: The House of Cards**
```
AI generates code faster than you review it
→ Unreviewed changes accumulate
→ Bugs and debt compound silently
→ System looks productive but crumbles under pressure
```

**CAT's Approach**
```
✓ Does exactly what you ask—nothing more
✓ Every change committed before proceeding
✓ Human review at every checkpoint
✓ Problems caught early, not compounded
✓ Foundation stays solid
```

Other AI tools optimize for speed and autonomy.
CAT optimizes for reliability and control.

## FAQ

**Won't this slow me down?**

The comic shows why "fast" AI isn't fast. You asked for a button, now you're debugging a
refactored auth module. CAT does what you ask, when you ask—that's actually faster.

**How does CAT prevent over-engineering?**

CAT presents choices at decision points instead of making assumptions. It asks "Add button to
existing form or create new component?" instead of deciding for you.

**How does CAT prevent the "house of cards" problem?**

Commit-before-proceed workflow. Every change is reviewable before CAT moves on. No silent
accumulation of untested code.

**Can solo developers buy Team features?**

Yes. If you want collaboration features for yourself (or you're preparing to hire), you can
purchase Team at any time.

**What happens if our team shrinks below 50 seats?**

Nothing changes. You stay on your current plan. You can also downgrade to Indie if you become a
solo operation again.

**Is there a free trial?**

Team includes a 14-day free trial, no credit card required. Enterprise trials are
available—contact sales.

**How does billing work?**

Monthly or annual. Annual billing saves you 2 months (pay for 10, get 12).

**Can we self-host?**

Enterprise includes options for custom LLM endpoints and data residency. Full self-hosted
deployments available—contact sales.
