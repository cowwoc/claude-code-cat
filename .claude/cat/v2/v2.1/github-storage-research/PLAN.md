# Plan: github-storage-research

## Goal
Evaluate GitHub-native storage options (Issues, Projects, Discussions) as alternatives to .claude/cat file-based metadata storage.

## Satisfies
- REQ-001

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Concerns:** Research may reveal GitHub APIs have limitations
- **Mitigation:** Document all limitations found; consider hybrid approaches

## Files to Modify
- (research output - new analysis document)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Issues evaluated as storage option
- [ ] GitHub Projects evaluated as storage option
- [ ] GitHub Discussions evaluated as storage option
- [ ] API rate limits and authentication documented
- [ ] Comparison matrix created with pros/cons
- [ ] Recommendation documented

## Execution Steps
1. **Research GitHub Issues API**
   - Verify: Document capabilities and limitations
2. **Research GitHub Projects API**
   - Verify: Document capabilities and limitations
3. **Research GitHub Discussions API**
   - Verify: Document capabilities and limitations
4. **Create comparison analysis**
   - Verify: Comparison document with recommendation
