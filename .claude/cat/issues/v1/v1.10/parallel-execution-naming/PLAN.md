# Plan: parallel-execution-naming

## Objective
rename 'wave' to 'sub-task' in parallel execution

## Details
Rename wave-based terminology to sub-task-based for consistency
with CAT's task decomposition model.

Changes across 6 files:
- wave_1/wave_2 → sub_task_1/sub_task_2
- Wave N/M → Sub-task N/M
- wave-based → sub-task-based

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implementation complete
- [x] Verified working
