# Plan: onboarding-improvements

## Objective
improve onboarding with guided first-task and tiered help

## Details
- Add first-task walkthrough step to init.md that guides new users
  through creating their first task after initialization
- Restructure help.md with tiered disclosure:
  - Essential Commands (3 core commands)
  - Planning Commands (add/remove/config)
  - Advanced Commands (power user features)
  - Full Reference in collapsible details sections
- Add minimum viable workflow diagram showing init → add → work cycle

Addresses onboarding gaps: no guided tutorial, no progressive disclosure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implementation complete
- [x] Verified working
