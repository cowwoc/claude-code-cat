# State

- **Status:** closed
- **Progress:** 100%
- **Resolution:** already-implemented
- **Dependencies:** []
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22
- **Last Updated:** 2026-01-22

## Notes

The status skill already follows the skill-builder methodology:
1. Hook `precompute-status-display.py` pre-computes the entire box display
2. Skill checks for "PRE-COMPUTED STATUS DISPLAY" in context
3. Outputs pre-computed content directly without recalculation
4. Fail-fast behavior if pre-computed content not found

No changes needed - task was already implemented prior to task creation.
