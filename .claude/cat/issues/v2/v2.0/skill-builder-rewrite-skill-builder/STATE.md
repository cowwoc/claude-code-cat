## Notes

Skill is meta-documentation teaching how to build other skills. The box-drawing characters
it contains are:
- Lines 246-247, 651-652, 717-718: Algorithm instructions for constructing boxes
- Lines 1165-1169: Flowchart diagram using ASCII art

This skill doesn't produce box output - it teaches the methodology for extracting
computation from skills. The box characters are documentation about how boxes work,
not templates to be rendered.

No changes needed - this is methodology documentation, not a skill with display output.
