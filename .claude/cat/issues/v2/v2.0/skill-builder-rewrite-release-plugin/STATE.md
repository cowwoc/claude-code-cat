## Notes

Skill has a git branch diagram using ASCII art (lines 252-259):
- Shows release workflow: v1.4 branch merging to main with tag
- Static documentation diagram, not dynamically computed

This is instructional documentation showing the git release flow.
No dynamic computation or alignment calculation involved.

No changes needed - the characters are static documentation art.
