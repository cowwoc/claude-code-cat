## Notes

Skill has a state machine diagram using box characters (lines 22-42):
- TDD state machine showing: START -> RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR -> VERIFY -> COMPLETE
- Static documentation diagram, not dynamically computed

This is instructional documentation showing the TDD workflow phases.
No dynamic computation or alignment calculation involved.

No changes needed - the box characters are static documentation art.
