## Parallel Execution Plan

### All Batches (Concurrent)
All 5 batches have no dependencies and can run in parallel.

| Issue | Files | Est. Tokens | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| compress-concepts-batch-1 | 3 | ~120K | None |
| compress-concepts-batch-2 | 3 | ~120K | None |
| compress-concepts-batch-3 | 3 | ~120K | None |
| compress-concepts-batch-4 | 4 | ~160K | None |
| compress-concepts-batch-5 | 4 | ~160K | None |

**Conflict check:** Each batch modifies different files - no conflicts, safe to parallelize.
