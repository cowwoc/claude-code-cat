## Summary

Replaced "OUTPUT TEMPLATE" pattern with "PRE-RENDERED" terminology across:
- 9 Python skill handlers (add, cleanup, config, help, init, render_diff, stakeholder, token_report, work)
- 14 SKILL.md files to match handler output markers
- Test expectations in run_tests.py

Also moved SKILL.md terminology changes from 2.1-java-skill-handlers branch to this task since they are part of the same preprocessing architecture alignment.
