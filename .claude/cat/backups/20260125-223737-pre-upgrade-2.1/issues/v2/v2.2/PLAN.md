# Minor Version 2.2: Demos & Marketing

## Objective
Create showcase pages with video demos for marketing and user onboarding.

## Demo Pages
1. **Task Management** - /cat:add, /cat:status, /cat:work workflow
2. **Git Safety** - Safe rebase, squash, history rewriting
3. **Multi-Agent** - Subagent spawning, parallel execution
4. **Planning & Research** - Initialization, research, stakeholder review

## Dependencies
- Requires v2.1 (Pre-Demo Polish) complete
- All naming and UI must be finalized before recording

## Success Criteria
- Each demo page has embedded video
- Videos demonstrate real usage (not mockups)
- Pages follow showcase-template design
